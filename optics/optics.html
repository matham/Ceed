is between 1.22m to 10m on the right of the projector, depending on the
focal setting of the projector’s lens. Although it’s the right of L1, we
use the provided “object” position. We assume it’s set at 1.22m.</p>

<p>The figure is read as follows, we input the focal length of the lens,
the position of the lens and the object (as output by the projector).

<p>L3 is a smaller lens that sits on the dichroic. By being directly
attached to the dichroic, it physically acts as an aperture, preventing
any stray light from casting echoes on the tissue. If the lens is not
directly attached to the dichroic cube cage, there is a circle of
interfering reflections around the tissue.</p>

lens is dictated by the positions of all the previous lenses and the
projector, as well as the position of the tissue. It is adjusted to get
a clear projection on the tissue. The final magnification should be
approximately 0.4% of the original object projected by the projector.
The distance between the center of the objective and the tissue should
be about 5.57cm.</p>

<h3>Dynamic Optical Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#dynamic-optical-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the following, we explore how the lens values were chosen and how the
lens values change the primary variables – the final position of the
projected pattern and its magnification. In all of this, we were looking
for an ideal magnification around 0.4% and the minimal image
displacement as a function of lens position for the zoom lens (L2).</p>
<div class="section" id="projector">
<span id="dynamic-projector"></span><h4>Projector<a class="headerlink" href="#projector" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

<p>This figure shows how the mag and position would change as we move the
projector left 20cm, or upto 5cm to the right. The largest effect is on
the mag, which varies between 0.38% - 0.5%. Moving to the left increases
mag.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dynamic-l1">
<span id="id2"></span><h4>L1<a class="headerlink" href="#dynamic-l1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

<p>This figure shows how the position and mag would change as we change the
focal length and position of L1. We chose <a class="reference external" href="mailto:7&#46;5mm&#37;&#52;&#48;-27&#46;5cm">7<span>&#46;</span>5mm<span>&#64;</span>-27<span>&#46;</span>5cm</a>.</p>
<p>From the right graph, while keeping all the other lenses constant we can
only increase or decrease the focal length (x-axis), by about +/- 20mm
if we want to maintain the current mag. However, we’d also need to move
the lens by a lot (+/- 7.5cm) to maintain the mag. On the other hand,
from the right graph, the image position will not change much.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../_images/image9.png"><img alt="image8" src="../_images/image9.png" style="width: 7.43242in; height: 2.19583in;" /></a></p>
<p>Using a 75mm lens, this figure shows how the mag and positon change as
the lens is moved +/- 7.5 cm. It does change the mag between 0.36% and
0.5% and the image position by about 1mm. However, it’s not practical
because the projector would also need to be moved as the lens is right
next to the projector. In addition, this does not take into account the
effect of moving the projector, as that will also affect the variables.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dynamic-l2">

<p>This lens is used as the primary zoom lens. We used a 100mm and zoom by
changing its position. From the right image, the lens is moved up until
the bottom of the curve and down to change the mag. If the lens is much
larger than 100mm, then its range of mag of less (we only cross 5 or 6
contours). If it’s much less than 100mm, the mag changes too quickly.
Additionally, from the right graph, getting much less than 100mm, will
result and much larger final image position change, which is
undesirable. 100mm, seems a good tradeoff, although smaller lenses can
be used to further reduce the mag if needed.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../_images/image11.png"><img alt="image10" src="../_images/image11.png" style="width: 7.34496in; height: 2.16250in;" /></a></p>
<p>Using a 100mm lens, we look at how changing its position changes the mag
and final image position. If we limit ourselves to the -25cm - -13cm
range, we transverse the mag range of 0.3% - 0.7%, without changing the
final image position much.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../_images/image12.png"><img alt="image11" src="../_images/image12.png" style="width: 7.37128in; height: 2.22083in;" /></a></p>
<p>For completeness, the figure above shows the variables when using a 75mm
lens.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../_images/image13.png"><img alt="image12" src="../_images/image13.png" style="width: 7.37090in; height: 2.22500in;" /></a></p>
<p>As well as when using a 15mm lens. 10mm seems pretty optimal.</p>

<p>We used a 30mm lens, that is attached to the dichroic cub. From the
right figure we must stick to lenses less than 40mm because larger
lenses will take us out of the required mag range. But, within the
10mm-40mm range, changing the focal length changes mag quickly. But
changing the position has little effect.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the image position does change a lot when the lens
position of focal length is changed.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../_images/image15.png"><img alt="image14" src="../_images/image15.png" style="width: 7.35722in; height: 2.19583in;" /></a></p>
<p>This figure shows how the mag and image position changes when the focal
length is changed (very quickly).</p>

<p>This figure similarly shows how the position and mag changes using a
30mm lens and changing its position.</p>
<p>Placing it right next to the cage, as required anyway to reduce
reflections seems optimal.</p>

lens (L7) and the image cannot be much less than 5cm or 6cm because the
lens and camera thickness prevent that.</p>
<p>As a note, this light path has more server restrictions and degeneracies
than the projector to tissue light path. We have no control over the
position of the objective (L4) because that’s predetermined by the
projector to tissue light path. Similarly, the minimum final lens to
camera distance reduces the options significantly.</p>

<p>This figure shows that as we change the object (tissue) position, if we
change the objective position by the same amount in the same direction,
both the mag and the final image position will remain generally
unchanged. This is good, because as we saw earlier in the projector to
tissue light path, if the objective is moved down, the projector will
project the tissue image by about the same amount further. Therefore, if
both the objective and the tissue are moved by the same amount, neither
the projector nor the camera positions and lensing would need to be
adjusted (perhaps by tiny amounts).</p>

<p>For L5, to have a good mag, we should prefer lower focal lengths. But
too low will have too much mag. We picked 80mm. For image distance,
focal length doesn’t have a significant impact.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../_images/image24.png"><img alt="image23" src="../_images/image24.png" style="width: 7.32979in; height: 2.20833in;" /></a></p>
<p>This figure shows how the lens position affects the mag and final image
position when using a 80mm lens. As can be seen, increasing the lens
position reduces the final image distance, which is a problem if it gets
below the minimum final lens – camera distance. However, the mag
increases. We placed it at 4.5cm, which the closest to the dichroic cube
we could place it so that the final image will be as far from the final
lens as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dynamic-cam-l6">
<span id="id11"></span><h4>L6<a class="headerlink" href="#dynamic-cam-l6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../_images/image25.png"><img alt="image24" src="../_images/image25.png" style="width: 7.39682in; height: 2.17917in;" /></a></p>
<p>The goal for this lens is to act as a zoom lens. Ideally, as we move it
up and down the final image mag will change through our desired range,
without changing the final image position by much. Looking at the left
figure, we see that a 100mm lens is the most optimum because when it is
moved up and down it will change final image position minimally.
Similarly, from the right figure, when moved up and down it’ll go
through a range of mag values quickly.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../_images/image26.png"><img alt="image25" src="../_images/image26.png" style="width: 7.40975in; height: 2.19583in;" /></a></p>
<p>This figure shows how the image position and mag will change when a
100mm lens is moved up and down. We can see how the image position
changes minimally, when the lens is moved through a range of mag values.</p>
<p>We can also ask how the mag and position will change as the lens is
moved up and down as a function of the focal length of L5 (the previous
lens).</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../_images/image27.png"><img alt="image26" src="../_images/image27.png" style="width: 7.33081in; height: 2.15833in;" /></a></p>
<p>Using 100mm for L6, this figure shows that as we change the focal length
for L5, the image position doesn’t change much. But, by reducing the
focal length, we can increase the baseline mag. So e.g. if we picked a
75mm lens rather than 80mm for L5, we would get a higher magnification.</p>
<p>Following we replicate the L6 figures using a 75mm lens for L5, rather
than 80mm above.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../_images/image28.png"><img alt="image27" src="../_images/image28.png" style="width: 7.30427in; height: 2.14583in;" /></a></p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../_images/image29.png"><img alt="image28" src="../_images/image29.png" style="width: 7.31667in; height: 2.19453in;" /></a></p>
<p>We can see that using 75mm, the image position change as a function of
lens position is even flatter than with a 80mm lens and that the overall
mag also increased. So choosing a 75mm vs 80mm for L5 can be changed
depending on the desired mag, if we need to change it by a small amount.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../_images/image30.png"><img alt="image29" src="../_images/image30.png" style="width: 7.36100in; height: 2.16250in;" /></a></p>
<p>We can also ask how the mag and image position would change if we move
L5 up away from the dichroic cage by a little. The right figure shows
that increasing L5’s position will not change the mag range for L6 by
much. It mostly serves to accentuate the change in the image position
(left figure) as L5 is increased. But that can be traded against a mag
increase if that’s desired.</p>

<div class="section" id="dynamic-cam-l7">
<span id="id12"></span><h4>L7<a class="headerlink" href="#dynamic-cam-l7" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../_images/image31.png"><img alt="image30" src="../_images/image31.png" style="width: 7.39764in; height: 2.18750in;" /></a></p>
<p>For the final lens before the camera, we need to ensure that the image
is not too close to the lens because otherwise the camera cannot get
close enough to see it. This minimum distance is about 5cm. Therefore,
for the right graph, instead of showing the image position as the
intensity value, we shoe the distance between the lens and the image and
threshold at 5cm.</p>
<p>We observe that increasing the focal length will increase the final
image position. On the other hand, increasing the final lens position
will only decrease the image position. For the mag, increasing either
the focal length or the lens position increases the mag. Therefore, this
lens provides us some freedom to choose the baseline mag for the zoom
lens.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../_images/image32.png"><img alt="image31" src="../_images/image32.png" style="width: 7.36007in; height: 2.15417in;" /></a></p>
<p>This figure shows the above observation more clearly, that for the
selected lens position, increasing the focal length will increase the
image position and mag.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../_images/image33.png"><img alt="image32" src="../_images/image33.png" style="width: 7.38074in; height: 2.17917in;" /></a></p>
<p>In the same vane it’s interesting to ask what the effect of increasing
the focal length of the final lens (L7) will have on the mag range as L6
is moved up and down. Similarly, how much is the final image position
perturbed? The above figure shows that as we increase the focal length
of L8, the baseline mag will increase. But, from the left figure it
seems that as the focal length increases, the image position changes
more. The following figure shows it clearly.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../_images/image34.png"><img alt="image33" src="../_images/image34.png" style="width: 7.31475in; height: 2.19583in;" /></a></p>
<p>This figure shows how the mag range and image position changes as L6 is
moved up and down when L7 is 250mm, rather than 180mm above. We can see
clearly that the baseline mag is larger on the right, but so is the
image position deflection on the left. This suggests that 180mm is a
overall good choice, except if higher mag is required.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../_images/image35.png"><img alt="image34" src="../_images/image35.png" style="width: 7.37794in; height: 2.17500in;" /></a></p>
<p>So far, we haven’t found a great way to increase the baseline mag by a
lot. We saw earlier that as we increase the position of L7, the baseline
mag increases, but the lens to image distance also decreases, which may
be a problem. The above figure looks at the mag and image location range
as the zoom lens is moved up and down for different L7 positions.
Indeed, we can see that as L7 position increases, the overall mag
increases.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../_images/image36.png"><img alt="image35" src="../_images/image36.png" style="width: 7.37609in; height: 2.17500in;" /></a></p>
<p>This figure shows the lens to image distance and mag values when we move
L7 up to 27cm, rather than 21.2cm that we used earlier. We can see that
indeed the overall mag increased, but so does the image position and
that the image position is more variable.</p>
