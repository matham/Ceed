Merging Ceed Data with MCS Data
================================

The following script shows how to merge the ceed h5 data file that contains all
the experimental data from the projector stimulation side, with the multi-array
electrode (MEA) data recorded by the MCS system.

The MCS data must be first exported from the native MCS format to the h5
format.
